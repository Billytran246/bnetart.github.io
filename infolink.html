        <p>The way I proceeded with my project was attempting to make it slightly informational and intentionally experimental at the same time. I was inspired by at first the the color themes of black and white and further transposed it on as Good and Bad vibes. Upon clicking the words, you would be brought upon a the page and a small description which is somehow personal because it contains a photo of me in each one! As you can see, this page here is found by clicking "Welcome to.. my World". I believe my concept is meant to convey some sort of graphic or partial visual communication in a artistic approach. The only hard parts were trying to find words that were appropriate for the majority of viewers that experience good and bad vibes.</p>
